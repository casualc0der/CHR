# CHR Test

## Setup
- Clone repo to local
- cd into ```charlieHR```
- *if required* grab gem (rspec) ```bundle install```
- run test suite ```bundle exec rspec```

## Parsing
- Run ```ruby bin/birthday.rb``` to output the birthdays

## Notes 
- I have tried to keep the code as clean as possible, and have implemented an additional feature to check for leap years
- Tests are located in the spec directory (RSpec)
Thanks, Edd
